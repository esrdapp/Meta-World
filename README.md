Buy Land, earn rent, sell for HPB - Exclusively for High Performance Blockchain

Meta World pays out 5% commission on land referrals!
Meta World dev fee is only 1% (To ensure sustainability!)

How does it work?

Firstly you deposit HPB in order to obtain Land tokens.

Land tokens allow you to earn rent every day (paid in HPB)

You can then either re-invest the HPB earned in rents (and compound your investment!) or you can cash out your rent earned (paid out in HPB)

Important to note, you CANNOT withdraw your initital purchase of Land tokens, the only thing you can withdraw is the rent you earn on your land (paid out in HPB).

The more land tokens you own, the more rent earnings you make!

When you re-invest your rent earnings back into Meta World, your land tokens will increase. Also if you buy more land tokens, the number will increase.

If you re-visit the website each hour, you will see your rent earnings (paid in HPB) is increasing every hour!

he best earning strategy in Meta World?

The most common strategy is to re-invest your rent earnings once a day back into Meta World, abnd do this one a day for 6 days, and then on the 7th day, withdraw your rent earnings!

This allows the HPB in the Meta World contract to grow, and it ensures your interest earned (potentially up to 8% per day!) stays high.

If you continue to cash out your rent earnings without re-investing into Meta World, your daily % of rent earnings on your land tokens will diminish.
